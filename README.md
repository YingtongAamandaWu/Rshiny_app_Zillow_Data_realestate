Would you like to know if you're getting a good deal on a property in a specific city? Are you interested in comparing your investment property with the latest trends in the real estate markets for every metro area in the U.S.? I just created this web-based app that is publicly available to you! The app is based on Zillow rental and home purchase prices that were published in late March of 2023.

Feel free to let me know if you think this is cool, or if you would suggest how to improve it! #realestate #zillow #shinyapp #sanfrancisco #investors #homeprices #investment #property #markets

Access to this free app: https://ytamandawu.shinyapps.io/Real_estate_cashflow_metroZillow2023March/
